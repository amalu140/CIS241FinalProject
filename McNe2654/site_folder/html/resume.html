 <h3>A bit about me and my career</h3> <br/> 

 <p> In this page of my website, you can find brief information about me in the technology field; since I am in the beginning of my journey, I divided the following sections in "Current" and "In the future" categories.</p>

    <tr>
        <td class="table-title">Desired Job Descriptions</td>
        <td> Currently I am focusing all of my energy in being a full-time student and learning graphic design by my own to advance my career in the future during the two years I am going to be working on my degree.</td>

        <td>My desired job description once I graduate is a Web Development position that focues on front-end development but also dives in back-end tools and programs; I would love to be employed in a company that has presence in Costa Rica and the United States. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="table-title">Current Skills</td>
        <td>Since I am at the beginning of my Web Development journey, my skills are fairly new and not as advanced; thanks to the classes am currently taking, I now have more knowledge about HTML and CSS and I am more knowldgable in some of the basic terms of web development; aside from that, I have a lot of accounting skills. </td>

        <td>In the future, I expect to have full knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as other technologies like PHP and Phyton; I would also like to advance my graphic design skills.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td class="table-title">Education</td>
        <td>Currently, I am on the first Quarter of my first year of a CIS degree, so my education is in constant progress between that I self-learn (Like graphic design) and the college courses I am currently taking. Besides that, I have an associate accounting degree & Finances Degree. </td>
    
        <td>In the future, I plan to have a Computer Information Systems: Web Application and Cloud Development Degree as well as having several certification related to my major, some of which I plan to get while studying and later while I am working.</td>

    <tr>
        <td class="table-title">Employment History</td>
        <td>My current employment history is limited to two internships I did when I was working towards my Accounting and Finances Degree; during those internships I worked full time as an accountant assistant.</td>
        <td>In the future, I plan to get a job in a web development related position in a company that maintains a presence in the United States and Costa Rica so, hopefully, I have the flexibility to work on either of the countries.</td>
